**FSphinxPHP** is a PHP port of the [fSphinx] [1] Python library, which extends the Sphinx API to easily perform faceted search.

This fork is the working copy I use on my search engine projects, which currently are only some personal projects and a large gun retailer at https://www.budsgunshop.com/catalog/search.php

I have made some minor code changes in many places to make this library easier to work with, but the updates will not be shared immediately due to lack of free time. I will try to get these changes applied asap and will update this description when that happens. Need help? Contact me at https://www.tapskill.com/contact

What's faceted search?
----------------------

Think of "filtering", "refining" or "drilling down". For example, when searching through a database of movie titles, you could get a list of clickable refinement options such as actors, directors, genre and year of release. Unlike static hierarchical navigation, facets are calculated as you search so you always get options that are relevant to your current query terms.

How do I use this?
------------------

You can incorporate it into your project using [Composer] [2]. Create a `composer.json` file and run `composer install`:

    {
        "require": {
            "gigablah/fsphinxphp": "1.1.*"
        }
    }

This generates an autoloader with namespace mappings:

    require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
    $fsphinx = new FSphinx\FSphinxClient();
    $fsphinx->setServer('127.0.0.1', 9312);
    $fsphinx->setDefaultIndex('items');
    $fsphinx->setMatchMode(FSphinx\FSphinxClient::SPH_MATCH_EXTENDED2);
    $fsphinx->attachQueryParser(new FSphinx\MultiFieldQuery());
    $fsphinx->attachFacets(new FSphinx\Facet('actor'), new FSphinx\Facet('director'), new FSphinx\Facet('year'));
    $results = $fsphinx->query('action');
    foreach ($results['facets'] as $facet) print_r($facet);

If you're not using Composer, you can use `fsphinxapi.php` to load the FSphinx classes.
